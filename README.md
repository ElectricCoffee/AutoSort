AutoSort
========

*Current status*: In Progress

Here's the gist of it:

- The program works from a specific folder, much like Dropbox
- Based on certain user-specified settings/rules, the program sorts files dropped into it, 
depending on which program dropped the file, and and what file type it is, AutoSort will behave differently
    - Example Use-Case 1: An image is downloaded from Skype, into the AutoSort folder, the user-defined rules tells AutoSort to move the image to a folder on the desktop, any other type is simply dumped in the downloads folder.
    - Example Use-Case 2: A file is downloaded from a web-browser, if it's a program/installer it's dropped into a specified folder, a compressed file is sent to a different folder, images to a third kind, and pdfs to a fourth.
    - Example Use-Case 3: The user drops any kind of file into the folder, and it is automatically sent to the respective folder depending on file-type or certain keywords in the file name.
- The program simply automates file sorting so the user won't have to.
